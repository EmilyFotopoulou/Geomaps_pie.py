Geomaps_pie.py  is a Python program designed to plot geographical locations and overlay pie charts at the centre of each plotted area. It also features the ability to present map density information using a choropleth map. 

The program requires a shapefile for the geographic plotting and a corresponding metadata file (in xlsx format) to generate the pie chart visualizations.
